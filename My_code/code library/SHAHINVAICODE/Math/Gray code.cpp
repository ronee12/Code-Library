/*
Gray code numbering system is defined to be a non-negative integers,
 where codes of two adjacent numbers differ in exactly one bit.

For example, for numbers of length 3 bits have a sequence of
Gray codes: 000 , 001 , 011 , 010 , 110 , 111 , 101 , 100 . Eg G (4) = 6 .

This code was invented by Frank Gray (Frank Gray) in 1953.

Finding the Gray code

Consider the number of bits n bits and the number G (n) .
Note that i Th bit G (n) equal to unity only when i Th
bit n equal to one and i +1 -Th bit is zero,
or vice versa ( i Th bit is zero, and i +1 Th is equal to unity.)
Thus, we have: G (n) = n XOR (n >> 1)
